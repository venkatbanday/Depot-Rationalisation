Depot Rationalisation
**Depots**  
The company operates various depots at different locations to store and distribute cargo. As a result, we incur expenses such as rental fees, electricity bills, costs for hiring local vehicles, and charges for loading and unloading manpower.

**Steps Taken**  
We have appointed Clearing and Forwarding (C & F) agents to manage the storage of cargo. They collect a bank guarantee and a fixed fee per piece for services including storing cargo in their warehouse, loading, unloading, delivering cargo to clients, and collecting payments from them. These measures have reduced costs and increased savings, while ensuring that payment for sales is guaranteed through the bank guarantee.
