# Depot Rationalisation

**Overview:**  
Maintaining in-house depots resulted in high costs: rent, electricity, vehicle hire, and manpower.

**Steps Taken:**  
- Appointed C&F agents with a per-piece fee structure.
- Collected bank guarantees for payment assurance.
- Transferred responsibilities: storage, delivery, invoicing, and collections.

**Results:**  
- Eliminated fixed operational overheads.
- Improved service reliability.
- Secured cash flow through guarantees.
